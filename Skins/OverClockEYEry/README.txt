OverClockEYEry was intended to be used as a way to keep an eye on your overclocks and present every sensor option available in HWiNFO in a functional and easy to read manner.


The file "SensorID.inc" in the @Resources folder will need to be updated with your particular HWiNFO ID numbers.

Run HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer for HWiNFO ID numbers and install the Plugin HWiNFO.dll in the Rainmeter Plugins folder.

Both of these files are located in @Resources\HWiNFO.


The SensorID#'s were designed to be intuitive and in line with the HWiNFO ID's. Your system may contain additional ID's or may be numbered differently. Additionaly, ID numbers may only be present when certain sensors are detected (i.e. external HDD's unplugged/plugged in). Check with the HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer for any discrepancies.


The MSIAfterburner Plugin is only required for the FPS gauge.



Hopefully you find this skin useful.

Enjoy and feel free to mod to your heart's desire!
